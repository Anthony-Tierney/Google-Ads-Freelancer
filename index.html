                                <p> For those already running Google Ads, I focus on quick wins in the first month while building a foundation for long-term sustainable account growth.
<br>
<br>
While every business is different, most clients start seeing initial improvements within 0 - 60 days of account refinement.
<br>
<br>
Google Ads is not a "set and forget" platform - it requires continuous monitoring, testing, and optimisation.</p>

                                <p>While every business is different, most new Google Ads accounts should see conversions within the first 30 days of campaign launch.
<br>
<br>
                                However, significant improvements and optimisation typically occur after 6-8 weeks once we have sufficient data to make informed decisions.

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>In my 8+ years as a Google Ads specialist, I've worked across a wide range of B2C & B2B industries including automotive, education, energy, food & beverage, healthcare, hospitality, health & wellbeing, insurance, fashion, finance, manufacturing, pharma, software, tourism... honestly too many to list!
<br>
<br>
My approach is industry-agnostic because successful Google Ads campaigns are built on solid fundamentals: proper tracking, solid campaign structures, targeted keywords, compelling ad copy, optimised landing pages, UX and more. What matters most is understanding your unique business goals, target audience, and competitive landscape - regardless of your industry.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Some of my clients are hands on and like to keep in regular contact throughout the week whilst others prefer a monthly check-in with some bi-weekly email comms. I work around my client's needs. 
<br>
<br>
Outside of comms, my time would be spent on initial campaign setup and ongoing optimisation, keyword research and management, ad copy creation and split testing, bid management and budget optimisation, conversion tracking setup, monthly performance reports, landing page recommendations and ongoing account monitoring.
<br>
<br>
My clients also have direct access to me via phone, email and WhatsApp - no account managers or middlemen like in agencies. I believe in complete transparency, so my clients have full access (and ownership) to their Google Ads account at all times.</p>

                    <p>If you decide I'm a good fit for your business after meeting, I'll need access to your Google Ads account (or help you to create one), Google Analytics 4 and Google Tag Manager (GTM).
<br>
<br>
Depending on your website setup, there may be more access required - but we can discuss this at the time.</p>
